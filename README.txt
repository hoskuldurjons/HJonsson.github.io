This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills. Visitors to the website can view my projects related to data analysis and visualizations, including a SQL project on Covid deaths, two Tableau projects focusing on AirBnB data in Seattla and Covid vaccinations worldwide, and a Power BI project on employees within data-related roles. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and communication.

In addition to my projects, visitors can learn about me and my background in data analytics and visualization. The website also includes links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. I hope you find my portfolio informative and engaging, and I look forward to hearing from you.
